# [Tarik's Teleprompter](https://merryface.github.io/teleprompter/)

Tarik's Teleprompter is a simple, web-based teleprompter application designed to assist with reading scripts smoothly and efficiently. This application allows users to control the speed of the script scrolling, pause, play, or stop the script, and adjust the font size for better readability. It also saves the script to the local storage of the browser, ensuring that your work is not lost even if the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Script Control**: Play, pause, and stop controls for script scrolling.
- **Speed Adjustment**: Increase or decrease the scrolling speed to match your reading pace.
- **Font Size Adjustment**: Increase or decrease the font size for better visibility.
- **Script Saving**: Automatically saves the script to the browser's local storage.

## How It Works

### Controls

- **Play**: Starts scrolling the script upwards at the defined speed.
- **Pause**: Pauses the scrolling.
- **Stop**: Stops the scrolling and resets the script to the beginning.
- **Speed Increase/Decrease**: Adjusts the scrolling speed.
- **Font Size Increase/Decrease**: Adjusts the script's font size.

### Saving Script

The script is automatically saved to the browser's local storage whenever a change is made. This ensures that your script is not lost even if the browser is closed or refreshed. Everything is stored client-side only.
